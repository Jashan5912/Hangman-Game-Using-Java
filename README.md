# Hangman-Game-Using-Java

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. In this game, the player needs to guess a word chosen by the program by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a hangman figure being drawn, and the game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or the hangman figure is fully drawn (indicating the player has lost).
